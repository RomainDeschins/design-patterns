I used the Facade Pattern to improve the home cinema program that I implemented as an example of the Command Pattern. In this program I had implemented macro commands that enabled to perform several actions at once in order to launch a movie (lights off, tv on, etcâ€¦). The Facade Pattern provides a way to have these sets of actions wrapped in a class so that the client only has to refer to this object in place of the more complex system of object.
