In this application customers are identified by their related client code. Client codes use to be represented by integers capped at 9999 and the getClientCode() method was simply returning this integer. As the client base grew further, a new standard has been decided for client codes: one letter followed by 4 digits. All new client codes are created using this standard and older clients are adapted to this standard using an adapter class.
