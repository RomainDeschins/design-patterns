This is a simple credit line program where the Strategy enables us to use different algorithms to calculate annuities, depending on the chosen amortizing structure (e.g.: monthly installments, quarterly installments, bullet repayment, etcâ€¦). The client side (Context) consists of several classes each representing a certain type of credit line. These classes delegate the annuity calculation to the Strategy. And in case of need, the amortizing structure could be dynamically changed at runtime, which would change the annuity calculation.
